<ul>
  <li>API: imbd.com </li>

  <li>Frontend: Angular framweork, no templates or UI libraries, only custom css</li>

  <li>>No backend, I will install a local server to test form signin and signup.</li>
 </ul>
 
 <p>This project was created to test my knowledge and develop it over time</p>


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
